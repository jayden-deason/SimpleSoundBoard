SimpleSoundBoard - WIP  
  
We plan to implement a few minor fixes and add a few QoL/new featuers.  
Here is a small list of a few things that are coming.  
Fixes:  
&emsp; Some files are retained after deleting a profile  
&emsp; Some files are retained after deleting a button that uses audio recorded by SimpleSoundBoard  
&emsp; Pause and Resume buttons do not display full text  
QoL/new features:  
&emsp; More helpful help menu  
&emsp; Ability to go back to Profile Selector  
&emsp; Improved placement and sizing for windows and pop-ups <-- Maybe  
&emsp; Ability to alter button color <-- Maybe  
These are just a few of the things that we are working on. This may not be a comprehensive list, but it is what I can remember. Items marked as maybe are not guaranteed.  
If we find other bugs or think of additional features, we will work on those as well.  
  
One additional note, SimpleSoundBoard ONLY works with .wav files. This is a limitation of Java itself and something that, to my knowledge, we cannot fix. If you have an audio file that is .mp3 or any other filetype, you will first need to use an external tool to convert it to .wav.
